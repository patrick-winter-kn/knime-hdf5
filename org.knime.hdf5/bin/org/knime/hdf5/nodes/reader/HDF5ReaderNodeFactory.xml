	<name>HDF5 Reader</name>

	<shortDescription>
		Reads dataSets and attributes from an HDF5 File.
	</shortDescription>

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			This node reads dataSets and attributes from an HDF5 File.
			The path from the root of the file to the dataSets and attributes
			will be contained in the output.
		</intro>

		<tab name="File Chooser">
			<option name="Input file">
				Select the path to the input file.
				<br />
				Supported formats are:
				<ul>
					<li>.h5</li>
				</ul>
			</option>
			<br />
			<option name="Advanced settings">
				Options are:
				<ul>
					<li>
						<b>Allow missing values:</b> Specifies if null/missing
						values are allowed or not. Null/missing values are the
						result of merging two dataSets with a different number
						of rows.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</option>
		</tab>
		<tab name="DataSet Selector">
			Specifies the included and excluded dataSets of the file.
			So this is the content of the output table.
			<br />
			<br />
			The usage is based on the Column Filter:
			<br />
			<br />
			<option name="Include">
				This list contains the paths of the dataSets that are included
				in the output table.
			</option>
			
			<option name="Enforce Inclusion">
				Select this option to enforce the current inclusion list to stay
				the same even if the input table specification changes. If some
				of the included dataSets are not available anymore, a warning
				is displayed. (New dataSets will automatically be added to the
				exclusion list.)
			</option>
			
			<option name="Select">
				Use these buttons to move dataSets between the Include and Exclude 
				list.
			</option>
			
			<option name="Search">
				Use one of these fields to search either within the Include
				or Exclude list for certain dataSets paths or its substrings.
				Repeated clicking of the search button marks the next dataSet that
				matches the search text. The check box 'Mark all search hits' causes
				all matching dataSets to be selected making them movable between
				the two lists.
			</option>
			
		    <option name="Exclude">
		    	This list contains the paths of the dataSets of the file that are 
		    	excluded at the output table.
		    </option>
	
	        <option name="Enforce Exclusion">
	            Select this option to enforce the current exclusion list to stay
	            the same even if the input specification changes. If some
	            of the excluded dataSets are not available anymore, a warning
	            is displayed. (New dataSets will automatically be added to the
	            inclusion list.)
	        </option>
		</tab>
		<tab name="Attribute Selector">
			Specifies the included and excluded attributes of the file.
			So these are converted to the flow variables of the output.
			<br />
			<br />
			Usage is the same as for the DataSet Selector.
		</tab>
	</fullDescription>

	<ports>
		<outPort index="0" name="Output table">
			All included dataSets merged together by columns.
		</outPort>
